# neocities-updates

> This is my Instagram stories feed on Neocities: it's live updating, has RSS, and is entirely hosted on Neocities. This is not the page's final form! I want to style it right and give it an actual feed instead of links. Make sure to add the RSS feed to your reader!

## Usage

Fork of [https://github.com/harrego/rssfeed](harrego/rssfeed) and modified to be more like a feed. Run with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
